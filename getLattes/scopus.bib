	abstract = {The adoption of solar photovoltaic energy (PV) among households has grown noticeably in the past decade given technological advancements and decreases in installation costs. Despite positive developments, several barriers limit the technology from diffusing rapidly through society. Many methods have been used to investigate how these barriers affect diffusion across Brazil, but often these barriers are investigated in an isolated matter, when in fact, they are interconnected components comprising a wider system. The objective of this study is to determine how payback time fluctuates according to various policy scenarios, how this result affects adoption rates, and ultimately, solar PV diffusion in the Brazilian household sector. A system dynamics model (SDM) was developed to assess diffusion across each of the 27 Brazilian States. The SDM included a combination of economic, social, and environmental variables, such as payback time, peer effect, and carbon credit price. The SDM serves to simulate different policy scenarios and their impacts on PV uptake, energy production, payback time and carbon credit accumulation in Brazil from 2012 to 2030. The SDM serves to simulate different policy scenarios and 27 their impacts on PV uptake, energy production, payback time and carbon credit accumulation 28 in Brazil from 2012 to 2030. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Business process management (BPM) and lean management (LM) are both recognized for improving organizational performance through continuous improvement, yet their similarities and differences have been poorly discussed so far. This paper aims to find their main differences and similarities using a systematic method for literature review. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses a structured literature review known as SYSMAP (Scientometric and sYStematic yielding MApping Process). The method integrates bibliometrics and content analysis procedures to perform in-depth analysis of the literature at hand. Findings: Both methodologies seek continuous improvement with focus on the customer and process standardization, but they are divergent mainly in relation to the flow they intend to improve. The impossibility of implementing both methodologies in an effective way was also observed, mainly due to the differences they present in relation to how to achieve the continuous improvement cycle. Research limitations/implications: As any other literature reviews, the major limitation is to have omitted relevant literature even though all available procedures have been used to avoid this situation. Practical implications: This paper offers a novel perspective from the practitioner side. LM may be better used in human-intensive process improvement whereas BPM in technology-intensive ones. Such characteristics open up new opportunities for practitioners aiming at integrating both approaches. Originality/value: This is the first paper that systematically analyses the body of literature of BPM and LM with the means to better understand their similarities and differences. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {One of the most significant challenges nowadays is the transition to more sustainable energy models. In this context, renewable energies stand out, among them, solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has evidenced accelerated growth in the last years. However, Brazil has a robust foreign dependence on the required components for the manufacturing of PV modules which might jeopardize the future growth of this energy source in the future. This paper aims at understanding the critical processes behind the PV supply chain and at assessing its performance using the ‘functions of technological innovation systems’ - fTIS approach. Through the fTIS, it is possible to diagnose the functioning of the system and the linkage between several influencing actors and networks. Therefore, the paper identifies barriers and drivers for the development of a PV domestic supply chain, whereby there are a large amount of PV installation projects, with low or no participation in the intermediate processes between metallurgical silicon and module manufacturing. The technology diffusion is recent and faces several tax obstacles to its development. However, the growth of PV systems projects hiring and the increasing of panel installers may represent an expansion in this industry participation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {Alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) are a promising alternative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector and ultimately, to contribute to a more sustainable society. Within the current commitments of the Brazilian Government to international agreements, in terms of emissions reductions by 2030, some new policies have been implemented, in order to incentivize the diffusion of AFV in the country. Yet, how will these policies contribute to the goal of increasing its fleet in the long-term, how long will it take and what are the differences (if any) among the policies, in terms of their effectiveness, are questions that remain unanswered. In this sense, the main aim of this paper is to investigate the impact of public policies in the long-term diffusion dynamics of AFV in Brazil. In order to do so, a system dynamics model is developed, based on the Generalized Bass Diffusion model, the Cobb-Douglas function and the learning curve theory. The model is used to test four different policies and some uncertainties related to: (i) the exemption of the import duty; (ii) the reduction of the motor vehicle property tax; (iii) the exemption of the tax on manufacturing goods; and (iv) a banning regulation for internal combustion engine vehicles in the long-term. The results highlight the importance of the current incentive policies but at the same time call for reinforcing efforts in order to increase the AFV fleet to significant values by 2030. Conversely, the banning regulation obtains a higher diffusion rate, but only achieves significant values by 2060. The paper concludes by showing the main contributions and policy implications of the effectiveness of the four policies studied as well as some suggestions for future work. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Isomorphic pressures are felt differently depending on the size of the organization and can disturb the adoption of Energy Management Systems, such as ISO 50001. Given institutional differences, how can government´s coercive pressures impact the spread of ISO 50001 in each size group? To what extent can they influence the overall spread of certification? This article applies the Bass diffusion model to assess the ISO 50001 certification over the 2016-2040 period, using a system dynamics modeling approach. It proposes an extension of the diffusion model related to market stakeholder pressure, based on institutional theory. The results showed that financial and fiscal incentives provided the most significant impact on the overall number of certified industries. Large companies are the most relevant segment for certification without additional policies, while smaller ones benefit significantly from incentive programs. This study reinforces the relevance that stakeholders have in promoting greener standards and initiatives, and offers useful lessons on the dynamics of adopting energy management systems. © 2020 FUCAPE Business School.

	abstract = {Technological developments along with the emergence of Industry 4.0 allow for new approaches to solve industrial problems, such as the Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP). In this sense, embedding Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) into Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is a highly promising approach to handle complex and dynamic JSPs. This paper proposes a data exchange framework in order to deal with the JSP considering the state-of-the-art technology regarding MAS, CPS and industrial standards. The proposed framework has self-configuring features to deal with disturbances in the production line. This is possible through the development of an intelligent system based on the use of agents and the Internet of Things (IoT) to achieve real-time data exchange and decision making in the job-shop. The performance of the proposed framework is tested in a simulation study based on a real industrial case. The results substantiate gains in flexibility, scalability and efficiency through the data exchange between factory layers. Finally, the paper presents insights regarding industrial applications in the Industry 4.0 era in general and in particular with regard to the framework implementation in the analyzed industrial case. © 2018 by the authors.},

In this context, it is essential to estimate the impact the transmission congestion might have on the reduction of emissions. To assess the effects of power grid congestion on emissions; first, it was necessary to design a simulation model, then some simulation scenarios were provided for analyzing the dynamic behavior of the wind-power supply chain.

	abstract = {The problem of techno-economic approaches to evaluating energy transition pathways has been constantly reported in the literature, while existing research recognises the critical role played by social aspects in energy systems models. System dynamics (SD) has been pointed out among modelling techniques as a suitable tool to evaluate the interdisciplinary nature of energy transitions. This paper explores how energy system-related SD models have incorporated social aspects through a literature review. Models were assessed based on their geographical resolution, time horizon, methodological approach, and main themes: supply-demand, energy-economy-environment (3E), energy-transport, water-energy-food (WEF) nexus, and consumer-centric and socio-political dynamics. Social aspects considered include behaviour and lifestyle changes, social acceptance, willingness to participate, socio-economic measures, among others. As expected, the representation of social aspects was not standard among the papers analysed. Socio-economic aspects were most commonly included in supply-demand and 3E models. Energy-transport and WEF models mainly incorporated changes in travel and consumption habits, respectively. The last theme had a more diverse approach to social aspects that deserves further attention, especially for energy access and justice issues. Other research lines include modelling approaches combination, enhanced participatory and transparent processes during model development, and use of SD models in policy-aiding and stakeholders’ information processes. © 2022, Aalborg University press.

	abstract = {Moving toward sustainable mobility, the sharing economy business model emerges as a prominent practice that can contribute to the transition to sustainability. Using a system dynamics modeling approach, this paper investigates the impacts of an e-carsharing scheme in carbon emissions and in electric vehicle adoption. We study the VAMO scheme located in Fortaleza, Brazil, as the first e-carsharing scheme in the country. We study two policies combined: a VAMO planned growth policy and a retirement policy for conventional vehicles. Our results show that the VAMO incentive policy is an important factor to reduce emissions and to increase awareness of electric vehicles, highlighting the role of the government as an institutional entrepreneur, stimulating and sustaining the VAMO scheme. The retirement policy in combination with the VAMO incentive policy obtained the best results in our simulations, reducing 29% of CO2 emissions and increasing 36% electric vehicle adoption, when compared to the business-as-usual scenario. The main conclusions are that such e-carsharing schemes offer direct and indirect benefits to urban mobility (specially to electric vehicle adoption) and that they depend on how the government supports them. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The way different policies mitigate CO2 emissions in the short, medium, and long-term is an ongoing research topic. Four potential policies for light vehicle fleet are investigated: (i) energy efficiency; (ii) modal change and regulatory management; (iii) renovation of the fleet; and (iv) biofuel increase. A system dynamics model is developed to estimate the delay in fleet turnover and its CO2 emissions change during the 1980–2050 period. The results indicate a rebound effect in the long-term when an objective of renovating the fleet is realized. Only if more stringent terms are considered will this policy contribute to further mitigate CO2 emissions in the long run. Results also demonstrate a longer-term perspective to energy efficiency and modal change policies, indicating the need for mandatory CO2 emission targets, unseen in the country at the present time. A biofuel increase strategy provides CO2 reduction in the short-term, and it is advisable this strategy be adopted alongside the other ones. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

For the structured literature review, the Proknow-C method was utilized. The search was made in the Web of Science, Scopus and Science Direct databases. Results. One hundred fifteen articles were identified. Three peaks in the number of publications in 2001 (5), 2002 (6) and 2006 (4) were identified. Conclusions. The publications were concentrated in the Social Sciences and Computer Science. The main keywords (Digital libraries, Information architecture and World Wide Web) already contextualize and represent the content of the recovered articles. In relation to content analysis of the articles, a possible convergence in papers aimed towards studies of information architecture and digital libraries is discussed, which is very coherent with the current literature.

The number of EOL batteries can reach 250, 000 units, representing environmental risks and loss of economic value due to improper disposal. Scenario 1, which represents a high recycling goal, demonstrates the possibility of recycling approximately 200, 000 units, which represents economic gains. Scenario 2 demonstrates the insertion of the second use practice, and by 2050, EOL batteries could store about 2 GW of energy. It is recognised that the development of different management routes can bring new business models, technology development, recycling techniques, and new areas in the labour market. Understanding the implications and the need for implementation of regulations provides stakeholders with the possibility to act towards efficient management of EOL batteries.

The department has four main processes: Foniñez (children fund), Fosfec (unemployment fund), Project Management and International Cooperation and Network Management and Alliances. The objective of this paper is to suggest an improvement in these processes through BPM application. Design/methodology/approach – The authors followed the BPM method proposed by Dumas et al. (2013) for process improvement composed by process identification; process discovery; process analysis; process redesign; process implementation and process monitoring and controlling. The authors modeled the processes by using the software Bizagi®. Findings – The actual processes work in an independent way and with no communication. Moreover, the department experiences short-term problems solutions and process inefficiency. It was possible to suggest changes in three out of four processes. Practical implications – Implementing BPM in non-profit organizations (NPO) addresses many of the current management challenges faced by such organizations. NPO’s researchers and practitioners should take BPM as a potential way to help in professionalizing them. Originality/value – The authors bring an original case study about a Colombian NPO. As a process-oriented organization, the authors use BPM as a management tool to solve many challenges that the company faces nowadays. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The growing population has resulted in the need for new alternatives that guarantee water supply to the population. Among the alternatives, there is the individual system for capturing and utilizing rainwater. The objective of this article was to test a municipal policy that makes it mandatory to implement the system and to attest how much it can optimize the current public water supply system through the construction of a simulation model. The simulation considered the policy implementation in one city, and the analysis of the results showed the effectiveness of the policy, which can optimize an average of 114,275.00 m3 in 2030, with demand reduction. However, it was verified that the isolated initiative is not sufficient to solve the problem of supply and demand. There is a need to expand the implementation of the policy to other cities supplied by the studied macro public system. Also, if the current management practices remain, the projection is that the current system will not guarantee supply for the coming years, mainly due to the strong impact of tourism on demand, needing new sources of supply, techniques and management strategies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

A strong feed-in tariff scheme based on the Renewable Energies Act (EEG) supported - and to some extent - enabled this development, but due to skyrocketing costs it already has been and will be further reduced. So far changes in public policy have only slightly affected house owners with photovoltaic panels on their own house, but future policies have not been decided yet. This article uses the methodology of System Dynamics to develop a model of the German photovoltaic market for small plants on private houses and tests public policies. Amongst them are different scenarios regarding the reduction or even removal of the feed-in tariff scheme in Germany.

We explore this empirically by using the MomConnect programme as a successful case of orchestration between the macro- and micro-level.

	abstract = {Against the backdrop of competing interests between mining developments, energy transition minerals procurement, and local communities striving to preserve their heritage and livelihoods, this paper delves into the dynamics between mining and social acceptance. Drawing from a participatory approach, the study offers qualitative and quantitative insights into this complex relationship. Cause-and-effect links surrounding social acceptance and mining activities are represented in a causal loop diagram (CLD), which illustrates how social acceptance is affected by trust, perceived procedural fairness, socioeconomic and environmental impacts, and (mis)alignment between government's and community's interests. The conceptual diagram aided the development of an adaptable quantitative system dynamics model, which is applied to a case study, the Barroso lithium project in Northern Portugal. Analysis reveals how low levels of social acceptance during initialisation and across the project lifecycle can lead to a significant decrease in operational performance and the amount of lithium recovered, while attempts to obtain the social licence to operate (SLO) are highly dependent on building genuine trust. The relevance of trust-building delays for decarbonisation agendas is also discussed. The paper concludes by delineating a future research agenda that points to embedding community engagement as core rather than side practice to leverage industry and policy decision-making towards just energy transitions. © 2025 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Various technologies have been disseminated to digest organic waste, capture biogas and provide sustainable energy. Despite numerous efforts to diffuse biogas technology in Brazil, uptake remains slow. This may be due to low recognition among key actors that support the technology with resources in a wider Innovation System (IS). We explore how actors view the existence of this IS in Brazil and its fragmented context. To investigate actor views and perceptions, we employ a factor analysis and an item response model to map out system functionality. The analysis unveiled the existence of a non-balanced IS, awaiting to accelerate its expansion phase given current entrepreneurial activities, but remains impeded by limited resources and legitimacy. Actor responses indicate that for the expansion phase to accelerate, energy markets need to be established via state and federal support. These markets demand support from utility companies who influence the IS across multiple facets (e.g., public tender, tariffs, energy auctions). Ultimately, the expansion phase is hinged upon the creation of a national policy that includes short-term objectives for biogas shared between stakeholders and an outlined role for utility companies to integrate renewable energy sources. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Shared Mobility Services (SHMS) are business models (BMs) that act as sharing economy platforms commonly based on mobile applications. They are conceived in a complex landscape characterized by the presence of information and the widespread presence of smart devices. In this sense, decision-makers, system developers, maintainers, and providers try to understand the interrelationships within this framework in terms of policy evaluation and/or impact on its successful adoption, analysis of all aspects of SHMS that affect the environment such as understanding patterns, user behavior, and improving the quality of this BM. To do this, models are built to capture the complex dependencies and interactions of these variables to guide decision-making. In this context, System Dynamics (SD) emerges as a useful approach to manage and capture the complexity/causality relationships of SHMS variables. Based on this, it developed a literature review to verify which research has applied SD to explore SHMS, analyzing existing models, their methods, variables, and impacts, as well as directions for future research. From a practical point of view, it is hoped that this research can be used as a guideline for urban planners and SHMS providers. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {This paper offers a system dynamics simulation-based approach to better understand the effects of solar photovoltaic diffusion. Specifically, the paper sheds light on how photovoltaic solar panels (PVSP) at end-of-life (EoL) might become an economic opportunity regarding their main components disposal and recovery. In order to do so, we base our study on the case of the five most significant countries in solar photovoltaic (PV) installed capacity in the world (i.e., China, Germany, Japan, United States of America, and India). Besides their relevance on PV diffusion, most countries still lack specific guidelines for the issue of PVSP EoL management. The goal of the work is to offer some tangible values to support the decision making processes, to guide the development of policies and regulations, and to reinforce the importance of scientific and technological improvement to achieve scalable recycling processes of the PVSP waste. Our simulation framework allows to estimate the potential market for PV deployment and to calculate the respective amount of PVSP at EoL, which could not be possible with other means due to increase in the average lifetime of the panels and improvements in recycling technology efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years, concerns have grown about increased demand for energy and waste accumulation in Brazil. Technologies that digest waste and capture biogas in the process have been presented as an avenue to address these two issues. Brazilâ€™s biogas potential has been studied extensively, however, less investigation has estimated production across time. A system dynamics model (SDM) was developed to estimate biogas yield over a 30-year period from municipal waste, feedstock, vinasse and waste water routes. The SDM was parameterized using open databases and literature, with a focus on technology diffusion. The analysis indicates production may reach 5.3 million cubic meters/day of methane by 2030 to 19.7 million in 2050. Exchange of information (via word of mouth) exponentially increased technology adoption rates, suggesting that production can be supported by disseminating information that promotes the environmental and economic benefits of transforming biomass into energy. Slow growth was attributed to an absence of policies that incentivized production and its research and development programs. These two hurdles presented challenges for adopters to overcome high upfront costs. Future efforts should focus on the solid waste and feedstock routes given that they assumed the largest production and fast growing population of adopters, respectively. Radical and integrated policies are required to reach substantial biogas yields from four routes to address environmental and energy concerns for Brazil. © 2020},

Even though the country presents one of the best examples of a successful implementation of clear and sound energy policy, it is still little known overseas. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to describe the evolution and consolidation of wind energy in the country, but also to point out the key future challenges the country will face. For such, we rely on data collected from interviews with experts and relevant policy actors in Uruguay, which had direct exposure to the wind energy policy. We made use of qualitative coding, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis as methodological approaches. Our results point to four key aspects that led to the success of the implementation of wind energy: public policies, market and actors, development and mechanisms, and niche-to-regime growth. Uruguay's main future challenges relate to how to keep up with new investments, mostly in other renewable technologies, while simultaneously keeping up with the know-how developed in the wind sector. The paper ends with some key lessons for public policy makers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Design/methodology/approach: With the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), the stock of discarded batteries will increase dramatically if no action is taken for their reuse or recycling. One potential avenue is to reuse them as energy storage systems (ESS) to mitigate the intermittent generation of renewable energy such as solar PV and wind. In a sense, the reliability for solar PV and wind energy can increase if energy storage systems become economically more attractive, making solar and wind systems more attractive through economies of scale. Findings: The paper concludes with showing that in the most optimistic scenario, EOL batteries will account for 86% of energy storage for wind and 36% for solar PV in 2040.

Results: the model showed that the policy of increasing the size of the team obtained the best results, with the absenteeism index stabilizing at 8%; staff at leave also stabilizing at 4-5 people per month, as well as accumulated stress reduced to baseline levels. Conclusion: measures to monitor physical and emotional demands, hiring staff, better technical training for so-called stressful activities, and a better distribution of tasks can be effective in reducing absenteeism rates and improving the quality of life of these workers. © 2019 Revista Latino-Americana de Enfermagem.},

	abstract = {Across southern Africa (SA), significant maize yield losses are attributed to invasive and parasitic weeds. Abundance of Striga (Striga asiatica) has become more frequent in smallholder farms (<2 ha) in the past decade. Various Striga control practices (SCPs) have been disseminated across SA, yet often, without decision support tools to inform extension officers and researchers which ones are most appropriate for smallholder contexts. System dynamics modeling (SDM) provides an opportunity to evaluate the efficacy of SCPs across multiple seasons in different agroecosystems and their associated environments. We developed a SDM to evaluate the long-term efficacy of four SCPs popularly used in maize-based cropping systems. Observations from studies outlining local soil seedbanks, emergence and flowering rates in farmer fields were used to calibrate the SDM. Model simulations indicate that while a combination of SCPs are necessary to manage the weed, future research should focus on developing smallholder-adapted SCPs that address the attachment stage of the weed's lifecycle (e.g., timely manure application) rather than its germination, emergence or flowering stages. Given the devastating effects S. asiatica has had on food security in Malawi and across SA, it is imperative to develop decision support tools like systems models to evaluate SCPs for smallholders.

Until the present time, the electricity industry has been widely studied in the field of industrial policy/planning, but not in-depth of creating value associated with the electricity utility industry. This paper shows that customer value generation has drivers, which could be different according to each stakeholder within electricity industry, affecting its growth. Each stakeholder has different interests that affect decision-making process and the customer value perception in long term, which impact on profitability. In order to illustrate how to identify and modeling key performance drivers to evaluate creating value in the electricity utility industry, this study used simulation with the system dynamics methodology. Through simulation scenarios, this study show that, the high customer value perception allow to align the electricity utilities industry to create more value. This is illustrated whit the case of some electricity utilities engaged in the generation and distribution in the Colombian electricity market of photovoltaic. The results show a new point of view that contributes to marketers and engineers in analysis of the relationship between the stakeholders and electricity firms. © IEOM Society International.},

The California Solar Initiative (CSI) incentive program aiming to expand the Solar PV installed base in California, included the PSS option. Little is known, however, about the contribution of the PSS model on the CSI program and if the CSI program acted as a catalyzer of long-term positive/secondary effects. In this sense, the aim of this paper is to twofold, first, to assess the contribution of the PSS model on the CSI program and second, to investigate if the CSI program generated long-term network externalities. A system dynamics model was built in order to visualize i) the influence of the PSS model on the CSI and ii) the long-term effects, i.e. network externalities of the CSI program. The results suggest, the PSS model led to a significant increase in the installed base of the program and in turn, the program led to positive network externalities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper explores how investments in research and development (R&D) and government policies impact the growth of renewable energy in Brazil, Chile, and Colombia up to 2040. The study presents four scenarios to understand how different levels of R&D investment and the presence or absence of supportive policies affect the spread of renewable technologies such as solar and wind energy. The scenarios range from an optimistic one with high R&D funding and strong policy support to a worst-case scenario with low R&D efforts and weak policies. The findings emphasize the importance of solid government backing and strategic R&D investments in promoting renewable energy and increasing the number of green patents. On the other hand, scenarios with limited policy support and R&D funding show much slower growth, highlighting the challenges posed by economic constraints and tough market conditions. The study shows that strong renewable energy policies could boost renewable energy adoption by 100% to 200%. Overall, this research adds to the discussion on sustainable energy policies and provides useful insights for policymakers and stakeholders to develop strategies that maximize the potential of renewable energy in the region. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The use of wind power has gained prominence on the world stage, especially in Brazil. In addition to generating energy free of emissions, wind technology is the second cheapest generation option in Brazil. At the same time, it has contributed to reducing hydrological vulnerability caused by climate variation. Although wind power has experienced a steady expansion in the last decade, recent poor outcomes of wind auctions produced uncertainty about the future of this technology in the country. This paper analyses the influence of contract mechanisms used in Brazilian energy auctions for the growth of wind generation. To do this, a scenario analysis based on a hybrid simulation model is used, combining agent-based modelling (ABM) and system dynamics (SD). From the hybrid simulation, the effect of the wind project cancellation policy is analysed, on the one hand, and different ceiling prices for competing sources in the auctions are assessed, on the other. Moreover, the simulation model shows how hydro conditions affect reserve energy auctions. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Energy supply and mobility are necessary functions of economic development and have become global latent themes concerning sustainability. In the electricity sector renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaic (PV), have grown significantly over its competitors in terms of investment in the past 20 years. Still, adoption of the technology has not grown quickly enough to decarbonize the sector. In the mobility sector, however, combustion engines have been replaced with electric vehicles (EV), illustrating a greater potential to mitigate emission of polluting gases. Still, the production of EV technology can yield high emissions. Instead of either technology working separately, both PV and EV may be able to cooperate in a manner where PV systems power clean electricity to produce and charge EV batteries until they return to a stationary storing system (i.e., second life) for PV systems. The following study investigates the use of EV batteries for PV systems, assessing the possible toxic effects on the environment from manufacturing, using, and disposing the technology. A review of peer-reviewed articles shed light on possible hazards of clean technologies in the energy and mobility sectors. Findings suggest the diffusion of clean technologies must be accompanied by policies that guarantee responsible disposal of them. The study concludes that advanced technological mechanisms for renewable energy may have significantly negative and sometimes obscured environmental impacts, which must be considered in future policies advocating for those technologies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This paper assesses alternatives to improve performance of wind-power supply chain with transmission constraints that contribute to enhance response capacity of the wind industry to changes of energy policy. In order to test these alternatives, this paper used a simulation model with system dynamics (SD), taking as case study Brazil. The simulation model represents the main time lags and fluctuations that exist in the wind-power supply chain. Four simulation scenarios were proposed to evaluate changes in auction-based policy in wind industry of Brazil. The results are related to operational capacity, inventory levels and response capacity. This paper provides an analysis of different scenarios that contribute with synchronization of auctions policy, including transmission capacity constraints.

	abstract = {Brazil’s wind power industry (WPI) has thrived since the early 2000s, driven by a successful auction-based expansion plan. However, the recent rise of cost-competitive solar power and policy shifts favoring other energy sources, such as natural gas, have created uncertainty about the future of wind energy in Brazil and reduced the wind sector’s legitimacy. Additionally, the cancellation of wind power auctions and support for other energy sources (evidenced by the new regulation for natural gas) has sent mixed signals to the market. These actions have sparked concerns regarding the future trajectory of the WPI. This paper focuses on the long-term effects of this energy policy decision on the so-called legitimacy function of the technological innovation systems (TIS) for the case of WPI in Brazil. The study aims to identify challenges arising from the growing appeal of solar power that may hinder wind energy adoption and to offer policy recommendations to strengthen the wind sector’s legitimacy. A system dynamics model is proposed to quantify such impacts in the long run, showing the interactions between the wind power capacity, wind generation costs, and the legitimacy function of the TIS. Results show the importance of policy consistency and institutional support in fostering a stable environment for renewable energy technologies like wind power to flourish. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Wind energy technology has been identified as one of the key renewable energy sources in South Africa. Currently, there is some uncertainty regarding the planned Wind build as the draft Integrated Resource plan (IRP) of 2013 has proposed a reduction from the original plan. Such uncertainty of wind projects is affecting the development and localisation pathway of the South African wind industry. In this context, we introduce a dynamic model integrating Systems of Innovation (SI), particularly the functions of Technological Innovation Systems (TIS) and System Dynamics (SD) for the evaluation of renewable energy policies in South Africa. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this article, we conduct a systematic literature review of past system dynamics (SD) simulation models of innovation systems (IS). By systematically reviewing fifty-four studies we present the current state-of-the-art of SD modelling applications in the IS domain. Our main results show there are four main IS policy areas where SD have been used, namely: (1) R&D policies, (2) innovation diffusion policies, (3) science and technology policies, and (4) regional agglomeration policies. Most of the studies have explored assumptions, hypotheses, and policy at the conceptual/theoretical level and can be characterized to be mostly exploratory modelling tools. We conclude by reflecting on theoretical and policy implications of these studies. © The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},
